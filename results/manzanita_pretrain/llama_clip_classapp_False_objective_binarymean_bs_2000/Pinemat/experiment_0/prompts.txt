Based on what youve seen below, propose a new program, called 'newfun', with exactly 6 visual attributes in it, that you think might achieve an even higher score. def newfun(image): return image.score(['Multicolored stripes', 'Multicolored, petaled flowers', 'hydrangea blossoms', 'ornate, carved designs', 'opaque, frosted, or stained glass', 'cleats or spikes on the bottom']) (mean score: 0.01057)def newfun(image): return image.score(['monochromatic image of sand', 'rows of potatoes', 'curved black surface', 'compact, spiky, evergreen shrub', 'various animals', 'minimalist composition']) (mean score: 0.01079)def newfun(image): return image.score(['white, powdery patches', 'greenish-brown stems', 'a dense, rounded crown', 'may be covered in lichen', 'found in temperate regions', 'associated with mistletoe']) (mean score: 0.01379)def newfun(image): return image.score(['dew-covered spider webs', 'glistening droplets of dew on leaves', 'sculptural forms', 'strange pink plants', 'systems of veins', 'marshmallow puffs']) (mean score: 0.01685)def newfun(image): return image.score(['glossy, smooth leaves', 'clustered flowerheads', 'twisting vines', 'lobed leaves', 'shortlived plants', 'ornamental ponds']) (mean score: 0.01809)def newfun(image): return image.score(['land with rolling hills', 'a variety of cacti', 'many small stones or pebbles', ' cumulus clouds', 'short, dry grass', 'orange-colored flowers']) (mean score: 0.01824)def newfun(image): return image.score(['twisting vines', 'lobed leaves', 'summer blooming flowers', 'clustered flowerheads', 'ornamental ponds', 'short-lived plants']) (mean score: 0.0189)def newfun(image): return image.score(['violet', 'lavender', 'pansies', 'petunias', 'dusty miller', 'queen anne s lace']) (mean score: 0.0202)def newfun(image): return image.score(['groundcovers', 'low growing shrubs', 'hardy plants', 'usually a park or other outdoor area with landscaping', 'loads of leaves', 'cedar shake shingles']) (mean score: 0.02253)def newfun(image): return image.score(['fast-growing climber with showy blooms', 'bleeding hearts', 'hostas', 'coral-colored bells', 'hellebores', 'sword ferns']) (mean score: 0.02531)
