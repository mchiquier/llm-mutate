iteration: 199 prompt: Here are some programs in increasing order of how good the attributes are at classifying an image for a class. The parenthesis next to each attribute is the score for that attribute. The programs are ranked according to average accuracy. We are playing a game of attribute discovery. Based on what youve seen below, propose a new program, called 'newfun', with exactly 6 visual attributes in it, that you think might achieve an even higher score. def newfun(image): return image.score(['a small, wooden structure', 'white belly', 'often white, pink, or blue in color', 'brightly colored', 'often brightly colored', 'sharp teeth'])
